\title{Extract Annotations from an ELAN XML Document}
\usage{
extract_annotations(elan_xml, distribute_duration_among_children = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{elan_xml}{An XML document object representing the ELAN file, loaded using \code{xml2::read_xml()}.}

\item{distribute_duration_among_children}{A logical parameter indicating whether to distribute
the duration of parent annotations evenly among their child annotations. When \code{TRUE},
child annotations that reference the same parent will have their \code{DURATION} adjusted
to reflect an equal share of the parent's total duration. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble where each row represents an annotation and includes columns for linguistic
references, annotation IDs, annotation values, time slots, and calculated durations.
If \code{distribute_duration_among_children} is \code{TRUE}, durations for child annotations
referencing the same parent are adjusted to distribute the parent's duration evenly
among them.
}
\description{
Parses an ELAN XML document to extract annotation details, organizing the information into a
structured tibble. Each row in the tibble represents an individual annotation. The function
handles both \code{ALIGNABLE_ANNOTATION} and \code{REF_ANNOTATION} types. It can optionally distribute
the duration of a parent annotation among its child annotations based on the \code{distribute_duration_among_children}
parameter.
